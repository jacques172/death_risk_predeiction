# death_risk_prediction
- Gained experience with decision tree by predicting the 10-year risk of death of individuals from the NHANES I epidemiology dataset 
- Dealed with missing data by employin mean imputation and multivariable feature imputation
- Achieved a better predictive performance using Random Forest which also minimized the overfitting
- Applied SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a cutting edge method that explains predictions made by black-box machine learning models, for better interpretability
